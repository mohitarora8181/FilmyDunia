# üé¨ Movie Show App

A sleek and feature-rich **Movie Showing App** built using **React Native**, designed to work seamlessly on both **Android** and **iOS** platforms. This app lets users browse movies fetched from the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**, view detailed movie information, and manage their favorites with **Redux** for state management.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Built with **React Native**, the app runs smoothly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **TMDB API Integration**: Fetches movie data dynamically using the **TMDB API** to show popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies.
- **Redux for State Management**: Uses **Redux** to manage global states like the list of favorite movies.
- **React Navigation**: Enables intuitive screen switching, allowing users to easily navigate between the movie list and detailed movie information.
- **Beautiful UI with Grid Layout**: Displays movies in a responsive grid layout. When there are odd numbers of movies, the grid adjusts gracefully for a polished look.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile app framework.
- **Redux**: For global state management (storing favorite movies, etc.).
- **TMDB API**: Provides dynamic movie data such as titles, descriptions, and images.
- **React Navigation**: For navigating between different screens.
- **Async Storage**: To persist data such as favorite movies locally on the device.
